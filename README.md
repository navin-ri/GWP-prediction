# GWP-prediction-dataset

This repository contains the input data used to develop deep learning models in the study:

**"Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Global Warming Potential Using PCA, Quantile Transformation, and Ensemble Models"**  
*Navin Rajapriya, Kotaro Kawajiri, AIZOTH Inc.*

## Contents

- `3D_structures/`: RDKit-generated 3D molecular structures (force-field optimized).
- `descriptors/`: Molecular descriptors used as model inputs:
  - `rdkit_descriptors.csv`
  - `mordred_descriptors.csv`
  - `alvadesc_descriptors.csv`
- `gwp_dataset/`: GWP100 values from IPCC AR6 report used for modeling (https://doi.org/10.23719/1529821)![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eba0692-fadb-4598-b343-f121d3c1229d).
  
## Notes

- All 3D structures and descriptors were generated by the authors.
- These files were used as inputs to build the GWP prediction model described in the manuscript.
