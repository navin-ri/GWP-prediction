# GWP-prediction-dataset

This repository contains the data used to develop deep learning framework in the study:

**"Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Global Warming Potential Using PCA, Quantile Transformation, and Ensemble Models"** 

*Navin Rajapriya, Kotaro Kawajiri, AIZOTH Inc.*

## Contents

- `gwp_dataset/`: GWP100 values from IPCC AR6 report used for modeling (https://doi.org/10.23719/1529821).
- `3D_structures/`: RDKit-generated 3D molecular structures (force-field optimized).
- `descriptors/`: Molecular descriptors used as model inputs:
  - `rdkit_descriptors.csv`
  - `mordred_descriptors.csv`
  - `alvadesc_descriptors.csv`
- `model_datasets/`: Training and testing dataset used for each ensemble model:
  - `rdkit/`: RDKit data split
  - `mordred/`: Mordred dataset data split
  - `alvadesc/`: AlvaDesc data split

## Notes

- All 3D structures and descriptors were generated by the authors.
- These files were used as inputs to build the GWP prediction framework described in the manuscript.
- 
A demonstration web application based on the trained model is available at: https://multi-sigma-app-v2-dev-jst3cplrqq-an.a.run.app/public_app/i07MbDalAR6xZhJ3lFAb![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d385393-899e-440a-b33f-302de00b96d6)
This tool accepts RDKit-calculated molecular descriptors and returns predicted GWP100 values to support external screening.
